# Iris Flower Detection

Welcome to the Iris Flower Detection repository! This project aims to classify Iris flower species using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is the well-known Iris dataset, and the project is implemented in Python with various libraries for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📜 Overview

The Iris Flower Detection project demonstrates how to apply machine learning algorithms to classify flowers based on their features. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the species of Iris flowers given their measurements.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the Iris dataset for model training.
- **Model Training:** Implement various machine learning algorithms.
- **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Visualization:** Generate plots to visualize data and model performance.
