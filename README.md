# **Iris Flower Detection**

## **Project Overview**

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flower species based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The project includes a Flask backend for prediction and a React frontend for user interaction.

## **Project Setup**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/github2python/iris_flower_detection.git
cd iris_flower_detection
2. Install Dependencies
Backend (Flask)

bash
Copy code
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
Frontend (React)

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm install
Backend Setup
1. Environment Setup
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
Install required Python packages listed in requirements.txt.
2. Flask Server Configuration
Navigate to the backend directory.
Make sure the iris_dt.keras model file is present in this directory.
If not, train the model using the instructions in Model Training.
3. Running the Flask Server
bash
Copy code
python app.py
The Flask server will start and listen on http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup
1. React Application Configuration
Navigate to the frontend directory.
Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Running the React Application
bash
Copy code
npm start
The React application will start and be available at http://localhost:3000.

Running the Application
Start the Backend Server:

Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory.
Run python app.py.
Start the Frontend Application:

Open another terminal and navigate to the frontend directory.
Run npm start.
Open the Application:

Go to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to access the frontend.
Model Training
1. Training the Model
Navigate to the backend directory.
Ensure you have the dataset file Iris - all-numbers.csv in the specified path.
Execute the model training script (e.g., train_model.py) or use the code provided in the repository to train the model.
2. Saving the Model
After training, save the model using model.save('iris_dt.keras').
Testing and Validation
1. Testing the Flask API
Use Postman or cURL to send test requests to http://localhost:5000/predict.

Example cURL request:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"features": [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]}'
2. Testing the React Application
Ensure the frontend interacts correctly with the Flask backend.
Verify that predictions are displayed as expected.
